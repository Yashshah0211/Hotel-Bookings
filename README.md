# Hotel-Bookings
This capstone project was built by me and my team during our internship, simulating a Data Engineerâ€™s journey. It covers data cleaning, transformation, warehousing, and visualization using Python, SQL, and Power BI, with insights into hotel bookings, guest behavior, and seasonal trends.
